# SQlio
Android SQLite Viewer (FDIT Companion App)

These are the core files which make up SQLio, an Android SQLite Viewer application. The application is capable of being pointed towards an external SQLite database (".db") file, downloading it, and viewing its contents from within the app. The app was built to be easily able to continuously point to a single database and refresh the database upon pressing a button (this may be updated in the future to be done automatically.)
